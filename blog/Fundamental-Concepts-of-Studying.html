        Throughout the entire article, the vast majority of the content consists of personal-experience-based theories. You shall not perceive it as universally accepted theories or facts, but rather as a reference or reminder. This is written from a non-professional who is engaged in studying :)

        <strong>Fundamental Theory of Individual Differences on Studying</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        Natural variables follow normal distribution, oftentimes. IQ distribution of human also follows the same principle. Approximately half of the global population has IQ scores within the range of 85 to 115. The question of whether intelligence is based on nature or nurture is beyond the scope of our discussion for now. Let's begin with our first assumption: intelligence is predominantly influenced by nature. Throughout this article, we will roughly differentiate individuals based on their IQ scores. However, it is important to note that a lower IQ score does not necessarily imply that individuals in that group are incapable of achieving the same level of success as those with higher IQ scores.
        <br><br>
        Many individuals find it frustrating when they observe others effortlessly excelling exams or displaying high levels of intelligence and efficiency. High IQ groups are less likely to be overwhelmed by dopamine rush and visual stimulation that can arise from today’s highly advanced information technologies. In contrast, others may struggle to eliminate such distractions, which can hamper their focus and hinder rational decision-making, such as avoiding procrastination. It is important to note that high IQ groups may appear to pay little effort in managing these challenges. Therefore, high IQ groups are often perceived as being content and at ease when tackling tasks, as they can primarily focus on the difficulty of the task rather than how to initiate it. This is why people often describe them as effortlessly excelling in exams.
        <br><br>
        On average, people tend to overestimate their intelligence, while individuals who are considered smart tend to underestimate theirs. This is because smart individuals have the ability to identify gaps in their knowledge and areas of ignorance while learning, which can make them feel inadequate. They have a natural inclination to ask questions, enabling them to establish connections and networks between different knowledge points, thereby developing a strong fundamental understanding of the subject.
        <br><br>
        “Are you suggesting that average people should give up?”. Nope, nah-ah. Instead, Try transforming the previous term “High IQ Groups” into “Disciplined Individuals” and observe the outcome. I don’t believe that would make much difference. While smart people may possess natural gifts, we can emulate their behaviors by modifying our environment and strategies.

        <strong>Fundamental Theory of Learning</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        When you acquire new knowledge, it becomes a series of knowledge nodes. It doesn’t matter how many nodes you have but how you generate values from them. Merely memorizing a collection of facts doesn’t make you a good learner. It’s about how you apply and interconnect that knowledge. What’s truly matters is your way of thinking. Consider when a new virus emerges, we place our trust in doctors, because they possess the ability to provide solutions. The number of viruses that they remember doesn’t matter at all. The ability to effectively articulate what you have learnt serves as a significant indicator of your learning and thinking, demonstrating the strength of the connections between your knowledge nodes.
        <Br><Br>
        Learning follows the Matthew Effect. How much you can learn depends on what you have learnt. Every subject requires prerequisite knowledge to understand. Your brain needs to establish a strong and intuitive logical framework in order to solve complex problems. Unfortunately, the effect is often underestimated because of our tendency to overestimate our abilities. We often rush through and skip steps, deceiving ourselves into believing we are being productive. It is important not to overlook the significance of spending time on basic problems. Learn to crawl, before learn to walk.

        <strong>Practical Steps of Studying</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        To cultivate a long-lasting study habit, we require strong incentives to make a change. Humans tends to be more sensitive and alert to negative information, as our ancestors need to be prepared when facing disasters. Oftentimes, we perceive people being so overwhelmed to the point where they fail to recognize the severity of their grades, attempting to cope by laughing it off. 
        <Br><br>
        Proactively keeping track of your learning progress is a good practice for maintaining strong motivation. You should be able to recognize all the topics by briefly listing them out. Consider writing down the chapter names on a list. It provides a clear visualization of your progress. This allows you to easily identify how far you are lagging behind, thereby acting as a source of reasonable stress and fear, which are essential to engage you into studying.
        <br><br>
        Get familiar with the materials at your disposal. Seek out effective exercises and reliable textbooks. It is expected that you dedicate time and effort to this, as it contributes the most to your effectiveness on your studying. It is both common and essential to adjust your strategies frequently and utilize a variety of materials to enhance your understanding. Being familiar to multiple materials  provides flexibilities for you learning journey.
        <br><br>
        To eliminate temptations and addictive dopamine triggers, you should adjust your environment. If you have to stay at home, clean your workplace to make it organized, logical and clean. Another common approach is find a dedicated place for studying, such as library and cafe, wherever you feel comfortable studying.
        <br><br>
        Lastly, every night before bed, remember to set tasks for the next day, so you can follow them effortlessly.
        <br><br>
        1. Keep track of your learning progress by listing out all the topics<br>
        2. Familiarize yourself with the materials at hand<br>
        3. Study in a dedicated place<br>
        4. Maintain a clean and organized workplace<br>
        5. Assign tasks for the next day<br>
