<strong>Introduction</strong><br>

        Our lives are shaped by companies. Your devices, apartment, necessities, clothes — they are all made by companies. But going back to the ancient times, were there really “companies”? If the answer is no, then how come we rely on them so much in modern days? Curious? Read on.
        <br><br>
        Let’s give “company” a simplistic definition: it’s a system that people utilize to make money. Owners use it to earn profit, and workers use it to earn wages. Make sense, right? Then what’s the action of utilizing this system called? Doing businesses, that’s what a company is all about. It generates goods and services derived from natural resources and labor, so as to make earnings.
        <br><br>
        Here’s the conclusion, business is actually a result of specialization. If we were able to create anything we need, why do we need companies and businesses anyways? Our time and effort are limited, so we need them. Every company is a group of skilled and experienced people who are ready to serve your needs, enabling everyone to focus on their own strengths and achieve greater output from the society’s perspective.
        <br><br>
        Yes, we need companies. But where did they come from?
        <br><br>

        <strong>Business in Ancient Times</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        In the earliest days, there was basic specialization, people’s occupations are distributed based on countless factors like personal preferences, abilities, social status and power. One point worth noting is that the arrangement is not based on experiences.
        <br><br>
        As time flies, people will find their own way to improve efficiency. They invent tools and are benefited from the principle of Practice Makes Perfect. The specialization becomes so deep that almost everyone is unwilling to quit their own position. There are no companies yet, only family businesses. As people age, what they can do is pass knowledge and skills to descendants. The cycle goes on and on. Suppose the efficiency of family businesses improves relentlessly over time, so people’s basic needs are adequately satisfied by the community. Then, when did company come into play?

        <strong>The Advent of Company</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        You’ll never see a single company in earlier villages. One may argue that companies are bigger in scale and better in production. It might be true, but can we really imagine how the first-ever company competes with firmly-rooted family businesses? We are not talking about merely a group of people working together, but a well-defined structured company, with managers and employees. It’s unnecessary and absurd for people to give up their home business. Well, it takes us all the way back to the First Industrial Revolution.
        <br><br>
        Machines changed the game. With machines, production efficiency was tripled if not doubled. They are tools, but very advanced. Duplication of a machine can be costly, so no one else can compete with the owner. You must work for the owner in order to benefit. Eventually, the owner becomes so rich that he can purchase more machines and start employing workers. Technically saying, capital formation occurs. 
        <br><br>
        Then, the basic hierarchy of a company is now formed - owner and workers. 
        <br><br>
        Now, imagine that you are the owner. You have a treasure trove of gold and cash. What would you do if you were out of time and effort? Why don’t we also make company management automatic, such that the whole company becomes a cash machine? We employ managers to help us do it, and we will keep the ownership of the company using stocks.
        <br><br>
        All by all, we need companies to satisfy our needs and a company is established by somebody who is too rich. In the foreseeable future, I will keep posting economic and business-related things on my webpage! Stay tuned and have a nice day!
