        Have you ever considered the idea of becoming an entrepreneur? In a world full of opportunities, it's common to feel overwhelmed by the success stories of businesses. They are often associated with fame and fortune, creating a perception that not pursuing entrepreneurship is synonymous with cowardice. In today's well-developed environment, building businesses has become more accessible than ever before. So, the question remains: Should you take the leap and start one?<br><br>
        (This article draws references from insightful perspectives shared from successful individuals. While it can serve as a helpful guide, it is essential to acknowledge the subjective nature of questions like whether you should do it or not.)

        <strong>Nobody Can Ever Define Your Success</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        Being able to reach everyone’s “life” on the Internet doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s good for you. Sometimes, it can be unnecessarily devastating to see your peers on social media enjoying all the sunshine and rainbows in the world while you are not. Showcasing their own race cars, giant houses and luxurious yachts, they promote the idea that everyone should start their own business to become successful.
        <br><br>
        I don’t mean to say that this kind of message is garbage. It’s often positive and encouraging. However, it also subtly tells our consciousness that if you are not doing it, you are a failure.
        I would like to convince you that starting a business really depends on one’s preferences. If you are someone who is willing to take risk that could takes everything you have now, entrepreneurship maybe highly favorable for you. But for those who need to take care of their families or struggles to meet their basic needs, ain’t no way you should found a startup.
        <br><br>
        The definition of success is different for everyone and no one has the right to define it for you. Being able to maintain work-life balance and spend time with your family can also be considered as a form of success without a doubt, just be yourself and be comfortable with it!

        <strong>What's the Next Move in Pursuing My Business Dream?</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        Well, then we can move on to the next step. Let me ask you a question: Why do you want to start a business? Is it because of money or passion? A successful business comes from passion. To become a successful entrepreneur, you need to have the desire and ability to dedicate all your time and effort into one thing.
        <br><br>
        Many suggests that business starts with an original idea. In reality, it’s not just about the idea. It’s about a feeling that you want to make a change. You start with what you enjoy doing. There’s no work-life balance, it’s simply your life with your business. Some people may argue that you cannot generate revenue from your passion. That’s because you haven’t applied a business mindset to your passions. Your business idea should worth all your time and effort to pursue.

        <strong>Passion Matters</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        You need to make sure that your purpose is strong and you genuinely enjoy what you do. If you do your business just for profit without establishing a purpose for it, your employees will seek higher wages. Everybody working with you will want to pay you less. If you have a purpose bigger than yourself and identify and install it within your business, you won’t be managing people anymore. You will only have to manage purpose.
        <br><br>
        By experimenting different ways to make money, you can develop your business further with the money. If the business has a purpose, you genuinely like it and there’s a revenue model behind it, your business will happen.

        <strong>Where Should I Start?</strong><br>
    </div><br>
    <div class="article">
        When it comes to execution, you should ask yourself what the first thing you can do to make your business idea to life is. It might be a Blog or podcast. Whatever the first step execution is, do not make it too hard for yourself. So step one is: come up with a simple execution plan.
        <br><br>
        Then what is step two? Starting a business. It’s the phase where the revenue will come from. You can do it within idea phase. For example, if you are a programmer, simply considering hourly wages might mean underutilizing your talents. Instead, you can work on your own programming projects and see if people love using them, or even consider purchasing them. Invest more time in doing things you love and excel at, instead of forcing yourself to improve in areas you dislike. Get obsessed by it, this is where a business idea emerges.
        <br><br>
        If you encounter a gap in your ability to execute the things you love, consider find a partner. For example, if writing is your passion, you could write a book and then find a partner or a publishing company to publish it. This is how your idea can connect with your passion.
